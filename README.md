# ARDF-80-RX
Project for an ARDF 80m receiver

Still at an embrional stage
The plan is to have a modern stable efficient ARDF receiver for 80m using SMD as much as possible, ideally finding all the components ready for assembly from supplier like JLCPCB, in this way people can place an order directly for an almost complete board.
